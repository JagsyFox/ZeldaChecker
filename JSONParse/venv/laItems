'itemname': 'Sword',
'obtain': 'Link will find his Sword on Toronbo Shores at the beginning of Links Awakening. It is his primary weapon for the whole game and it should be equipped at all times, except when Link needs some other items out to get past an obstacle.'

Koholint Sword
This is the reward for finding 20 Secret Seashells. The L-2 Sword is stronger than the previous Sword, and it can also shoot beams when Link has full health. After obtaining it, the other six Secret Seashells Link never found will disappear. It is found in the Seashell Mansion south of Kanalet Castle.

Shield
The Shield is the first item Link will receive in Links Awakening. Link gets it back from Tarin shortly after he wakes up in Marin and Tarins House. This Shield can block projectiles, and that is pretty much it. A lot of players find themselves using it less and less as they progress through the game.

Mirror Shield
The Mirror Shield resides in Eagles Tower, the seventh dungeon in Links Awakening. It can reflect certain types of beams like fire that the old Shield could not reflect before. Although it is obtained as the dungeon item, it has little use in the battle with Evil Eagle. It blocks his feathers so Link wont fall off the tower as easily.

Bomb
Bombs are in almost every Zelda game, and Links Awakening is no exception. They can destroy enemies, blow up weak walls, and more. They come in handy for many situations. The amount Link can hold can be upgraded to 60 Bombs if he goes down a hidden staircase near Marthas Bay where Mad Batter will give Link the upgrade as a "curse". Also, Bombs can be used with Arrows to make Bomb Arrows when the player puts Bombs on one button and Arrows on the other button. Then, by pressing both buttons at the same time, it will launch a Bomb Arrow.

Boomerang
Unlike other Zelda titles, the Boomerang is one of the strongest weapons in the whole game. It can destroy a lot of enemies in a single hit, as well as retrieve items off the ground such as Rupees. It can be found in a cave behind a bombable wall in Toronbo Shores. If Link has obtained the Magnifying Lens, Link will see a Goriya in the cave; Link should trade the item on the B Button (the Deluxe Shovel is recommended) to him in exchange for the Boomerang. The Boomerang can also defeat DethI, the final boss, in a single hit.

Bow
The Bow can be found in the Town Tool Shop found in Mabe Village mid-way through the game for a whopping 980 Rupees. A lot of Rupees, but the monopoly Link will have to do for this item is worth it. The Bow can shoot Arrows to activate switches, defeat enemies, and more. Since it does all that, it is recommended Link gets it as early as he can.

Hookshot
The Hookshot can be found in the fifth dungeon of Links Awakening, Catfishs Maw. It can propel Link towards certain materials, pull items towards him, defeat enemies, and much more. The Hookshot has appeared in most of the main canon games in the series. It stretches across most of the screen, making it a very useful item overall.

Magic Powder
The Magic Powder can be used for several things. It can light torches, help destroy enemies, and many other uses. It is obtained by finding the Sleepy Toadstool in the Mysterious Woods and giving it to Syrup the Witch. When Mad Batter gives Link the upgrade as a "curse", Link can hold up to 40 Magic Powder at once.

Magic Rod
Found in Turtle Rock, the Magic Rod, like the Hook Shot, is one of the best weapons in the game. It shoots a blast of fire that is not only good at defeating enemies, but also at lighting torches. Like many items obtained in dungeons, the Magic Rod is used mainly for defeating the boss of Turtle Rock, Hot Head.

Ocarina
The Ocarina is found in the Dream Shrine in Mabe Village. Link can learn to play three songs on the Ocarina. The Ballad of the Wind Fish is one of the first songs Link learns in his adventure. When played on the Ocarina along with the Eight Instruments of the Sirens, the Wind Fishs Egg will open. Although not required, Links next song he learns is the Manbos Mambo that will warp Link to Manbos Pond, near Crazy Tracys Health Spa, and can be also used to warp Link to the beginning of a dungeon. The Frogs Song of Soul is the last song Link learns on the Ocarina which will revive the Flying Rooster.

Pegasus Boots
The Pegasus Boots can be found in Key Cavern, the third dungeon in Links Awakening. The pair of boots can be used with a couple of other items to make great effects. One of the many uses includes dashing them with the Sword which can be used to dash through certain type of rocks, or using the Rocs Feather with the boots for longer jumps.

Power Bracelet L-1
Deep within Bottle Grotto, the second dungeon of the game, the Power Bracelet can be found. It can make Link lift up many different objects like rocks, pots, etc. This item is vital on defeating the boss of Bottle Grotto, the Genie. By using the Power Bracelet, Link can throw the Genies bottle against the wall many times before it breaks.

Power Bracelet L-2
An upgrade for the Power Bracelet, this Power Bracelet is obtained in the Face Shrine, the sixth dungeon in Links Awakening. While being similar to the Power Bracelet found in Bottle Grotto, Link can now lift heavier objects. Like most items, it is needed to explore more of the Face Shrine due to the heavy elephant statues Link will find within it. Later, Link can use the upgraded Power Bracelet to lift an iron ball used in Eagles Tower.

Rocs Feather
For the first time ever in a Zelda game, Link can now jump! The Rocs Feather can be found in Tail Cave. The use is simple. The player should equip it on either the A or B button and use it to jump. This feather comes in heavy use for the rest of the game, whether it is pits, hazardous surfaces, or just using it for fun.

Deluxe Shovel
A little through the game, the Deluxe Shovel can be bought in the Town Tool Shop for 200 Rupees. It can dig up things from the ground such as Hearts, Rupees, etc. Also, in some locations, it can dig up things like Secret Seashells and other items. When Link discovers the Goriya that wields the Boomerang, it is recommended that Link should trade this item to him for the Boomerang. Dont worry, as Link can always get it back if he will need it.


Flippers
Found in Anglers Tunnel, the Flippers let Link swim in deep water. Press the A Button repeatedly to swim in the water. Press the B Button to dive down underwater to sometimes find items in certain places and underwater passages. These are automatic, meaning as soon as Link gets them, he will be able to swim in deep water automatically.


Red Tunic
The Red Tunic can be found at the end of the Color Dungeon. Link can choose between this tunic and the Blue Tunic. This tunic gives Link more attack power overall, practically making all enemies and some bosses health cut down by a half of what it was before. Once he has picked the Red Tunic, Link cannot go back and change his mind for the blue one.

Blue Tunic
The Blue Tunic can be found at the end of the Color Dungeon. Link can choose between this one and the Red Tunic. This tunic gives Link more defense overall, practically doubling his health. Once Link has picked the Blue Tunic, he cannot go back and change his mind for the red one.
